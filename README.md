# Beacon Shulker

> A Minecraft 1.16.x data pack that allows you to easily transport your beacons around.

## Installation

Download the latest release from [here][latest] and put the datapack zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world.

## Usage

Just place an empty `Shulker Box` on top of a working beacon. The beacon gets stored inside the `Shulker Box`. To restore your beacon, place the `Shulker Box` again. The beacon replaces all blocks that are in its way (except for bedrock), you won't get block drops from them. The beacon block itself will be placed below the `Shulker Box`, so you need some room under it.

## FAQ

**Q:** But why though?

**A:** I've decorated my beacon using some netherite blocks and I can tell you, mining those without Haste II is annoying...

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the datapack, run the `zerotask:beacon_shulker/uninstall` function and remove the datapack from your world save. Afterwards, run `reload`.

> **Note:** Already shulkered beacons won't be placed automatically and cannot be placed again after `/reload`. Make sure to place them beforehand.
